The ft_printf Function:

Recreating the Versatility of the Standard printf

As part of your ongoing work at 42 University, you have been tasked with developing your own implementation of the standard printf function from the C library.
The ft_printf function is a crucial component of your custom library, as it allows you to format and print output in a flexible and powerful way.
Your implementation of ft_printf must closely match the behavior and capabilities of the original printf function. This includes supporting a wide range of format specifiers, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and pointers, as well as handling various modifier flags and field widths.
To achieve this, you have likely needed to write a series of helper functions, such as ft_ptr to handle the formatting of pointers.
These functions work together to parse the input format string, extract the relevant data, and generate the desired output.
The successful completion of the ft_printf function demonstrates your understanding of string manipulation, argument parsing,
and the inner workings of the standard C library. It also showcases your ability to design and implement a complex,
reusable function that can be easily integrated into your own projects or shared with others.
By recreating the functionality of printf, you are not only strengthening your C programming skills but also expanding the capabilities of your custom library.
This achievement will serve you well as you continue your journey in software development at 42 University.
